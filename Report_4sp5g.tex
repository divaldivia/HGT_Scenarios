\subsection{How to identify HGT and correct the orthology graph}
	Let T be a tree with $L_T=\{ g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4, h\}$ which correspond to four species $A, B, C$ and $D$, and say that $g_1$ and $g_2$ are in the same species, implying that one of them was acquired via HGT. We assume it is known which is the HGT donor ($h$). 
	\\
	How to correct the orthology graph of T:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Identify the HGT receptor ($h'$):
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be the sets of four genes such that $\{g_1, g_2, h\} \in G_1,G_2$.
				\item Generate the colored orthology graphs for $G_1$ and $G_2$ and add them to generate a five-vertex graph with two colors.
				\item Identify the bidirectional edges of $g_1$ and $g_2$.
				\item Choose as $h'$, the vertex ($g_1$ or  $g_2$) which has a bi-colored and bidirectional edge.
%				\item \textit{Choose as $h$ the other vertex of this bi-colored and bidirectional edge.}
			\end{itemize}
		\item Delete $h'$ and its edges from the five-vertex graph.
		\item Complete the unidirectional edges to bidirectional edges. 
	\end{enumerate}
